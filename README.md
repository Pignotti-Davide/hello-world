# hello-world

Hi all

I'm a student from Rome who is going to get a degree in IT engineering. At a first sight, it seems this service will be very useful for improoving my knowledge and skills. Of course I hope I'will give my contribution to your's too if i can, ..even if I think that I still have a lot to learn.

In Italy we say:"The old man didn't want to die because he never stopped learning"
